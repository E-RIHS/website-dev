Not a single system, but a hub connecting people, projects and systems. Registry of people, work and knowledge \u2013 recognising peoples work and disseminating activities and resources to the field. Potentially providing a guide to current best practice \u2013 tools, data and methodologies. Offering a discussion forum for past, current and future work \u2013 allowing the possibility of aggregating and building on previous work. Along with the potential for connected or shared Data Resources and Repositories, providing a collaboration platform for related projects and groups.</p>",
