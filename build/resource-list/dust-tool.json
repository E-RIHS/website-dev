	"comment": "The Dust Tool predicts the deposition of particulate matter on surfaces. It calculates how long it will take for a surface to become visibly dirty, given a known concentration of particulate matter in the air. It is best used as an educational tool, to explore interactively the factors that cause the soiling of indoor surfaces.",
