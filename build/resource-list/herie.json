	"comment": "HERIe is a digital decision-supporting platform providing remote access to data manipulation tools and to quantitative assessment of risks to heritage assets. The platform contains modules corresponding to the environmental agents of deterioration: air pollutants, fire, light (UV,IR), incorrect temperature or relative humidity causing chemical degradation and physical damage. Risks from environmental conditions are assessed by analysing data prevailing in a space in which an object is displayed or stored. It contains also a module for data processing. HERIe is freely available for conservation professionals and decision-makers.",
